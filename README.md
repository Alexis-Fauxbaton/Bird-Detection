# Bird-Detection

This project aims at testing several methods to differentiate bird-made sounds from other audio signals. The datasets used are available at https://github.com/DAGsHub/audio-datasets/tree/main/Bird-Audio-Detection-challenge. "Wav" folder for each dataset should be pasted here, at the root of the project, as well as the csv document containing the labels.
